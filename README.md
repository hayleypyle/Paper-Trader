This is a website that can simulate buying and selling stocks for the user. 
- The user can buy and sell stocks for Apple, Microsoft, and Google.
- The user can view the history of stock price for Apple, Microsoft, and Google as a graph using yahoofinance.
- The user is given an initial balance of $10000 which updates with every sale and purchase of stocks. This balance saves in localstorage.
- The user can see how many stocks they own from each company. These values update and save in localstorage with each completed transaction.
- The user can reset the simluation to restore the stocks owned to 0, and restore their balance to the initial balance.
- 
- This website uses .html, .css, python, and python django.
